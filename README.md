# Guess Game

Welcome to the **Guess Game** repository! This project features a simple, interactive number guessing game designed to be both entertaining and educational. The goal of the project is to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts.

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools Used
This project was developed using Python and leverages:

1. **Random Module**: For generating random numbers.
2. **Basic Input/Output Operations**: To interact with the player via the console.
3. **Control Structures**: To guide the game logic and decision-making.

## 🌐 Game Overview
The game allows players to:

- Guess a number randomly generated between 1 and 20.
- Receive feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Track the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.

Key Features:
- Input validation to ensure guesses are within range.
- Dynamic hints to assist the player in narrowing down the correct number.

## 🚀 How to Play

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyberfantics/Guess-Game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder and run the script:
   ```bash
